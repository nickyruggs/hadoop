# Hadoop
Scripts for working with hadoop and Isilon.

I have created this git to share my scripts with the commnuity that help integrate EMC's Isilon platform with Hadoop.

parse_passwd.pl - use this to create the isilon commands to create users and directories from existing passwd and group files.
		Update 6/19/2022 - Updated for CDP, creates directroy structure on PowerScale.


create_local_homedirs.sh - use this script to create the local directories that were in the passwd stub file from the isilon create users script.

Check back later for more.

# Hadoop
Scripts for working with hadoop and Isilon.

I have created this git to share my scripts with the commnuity that help integrate EMC's Isilon platform with Hadoop.

parse_passwd.pl - use this to create the isilon commands to create users and directories from existing passwd and group files.  Very helpful in a rebuild.

Check back later for more.
